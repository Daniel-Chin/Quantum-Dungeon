- 使用 wave function collapse 生成地牢。  
- 但是每回合都会根据现有视野重新生成！包括道具，敌人。  
- 门开两次之后变成墙。  
- 开局就有目的地, food, 和宝物的视野，你需要多次尝试让走廊连过去。  
- Enemies can spawn at the boundary of your vision. 

Quantum
    if standing at door and adjacent is invisible,
        generate room
    extend from visible paths
        make up junctions and doors
        if happens to connect to exit room,
            accept?
            try to avoid?

floor tile is diff for a room, so generation knows. 
ROoms of different "styles" can just have different floor tiles. the floor may share texture. 
backrooms: Pillar matrix! 

Telepathy: reveals enemies. 
    this is bad! You can't use vision to "despawn" enemies any more!

Story
    First, you have an item, reality scrambler. 
        Using it will consume heat, but scrambles dungeon. 
        Then you toss it into lava. 
        That's how the main game begins.

quantum method
    generate rooms whose doors are visible
        stochastically grow one room at a time
    extend from visible paths
        make up junctions and rooms
        if happens to connect to exit room, accept with probability
    handle the exit room
        paint a path towards paths / rooms
        if fails, the exit room is unconnected!!!
    CONCLUSION:
        no need to have a consistent dungeon every frame! The player can observe so little, they can hardly prove contradiction!
